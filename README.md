# Component State

This branch uses component state [(setState)](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) to manage state in the application.

## Pros

1.  Easy to understand. `setState` is your bread and butter for React.
1.  It's an evergreen React API.

## Cons

1.  Component tree rerenders with each call to `setState`.
